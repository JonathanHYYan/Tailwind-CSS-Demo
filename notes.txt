>>>Dynamic SVG to reduce the number of svg arrow assets
Arrow Colors:
Blue Aurora: #8b7ba2
Fruit Bowl: #c8d301
UPP: #3c63ad

interesting things to point out in interview:
Implicit styling on svg's and pngs are not the same, svg has implicit block and vertical-align: middle whilst ful_logo.png does not and therefore requires additional positional css. upp_logo.png with the exact same styling had implicit vertical-alignment
